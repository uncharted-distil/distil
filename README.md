## Dependencies

- [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language binaries with the `GOPATH` environment variable specified and `$GOPATH/bin` in your `PATH`.
- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) JavaScript runtime.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) platform.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (optional) for managing multi-container dev environments.

## Development

#### Clone the repository:

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/unchartedsoftware
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/unchartedsoftware
git clone git@github.com:unchartedsoftware/distil.git
cd distil
```

#### Install protocol buffer compiler:

Linux

```bash
curl -OL https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v3.3.0/protoc-3.3.0-linux-x86_64.zip
unzip protoc-3.3.0-linux-x86_64.zip -d protoc3
sudo mv protoc3/bin/protoc /usr/bin/protoc
```

OSX

```bash
curl -OL https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v3.3.0/protoc-3.3.0-osx-x86_64.zip
unzip protoc-3.3.0-osx-x86_64.zip -d protoc3
mv protoc3/bin/protoc /usr/bin/protoc
```

#### Install remaining dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

#### Compile the protocol buffer definitions:

```bash
make proto
```

#### Docker images:

The application depends on:
- ElasticSearch
- PostgreSQL
- TA2 Pipline Stub

Docker images (with data) for all are available at the following registries:

```
docker.uncharted.software
primitives.azurecr.io
registry.datadrivendiscovery.org
```

##### Login to Docker Registry:

```bash
sudo docker login docker.uncharted.software
```

#### Pull Images:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

#### Running the app:

Using three separate terminals:

Launch docker containers via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Build and watch webapp:
```bash
yarn watch
```

Build, watch, and run server:
```bash
make watch
```

### Deployment

#### Docker Images:

Deployment relies on three additional components:

- New Knowledge Classification
- New Knowledge Ranking
- Qntfy TA2 Pipeline Server

Docker images are available at the following registries:

```
primitives.azurecr.io
registry.datadrivendiscovery.org
```

##### Login to Docker Registries:

```bash
sudo docker login primitives.azurecr.io
sudo docker login registry.datadrivendiscovery.org
```

#### Clone TA2 Pipeline Repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.datadrivendiscovery.org/uncharted_qntfy/ta3ta2_integration
```

#### Pull images:

```bash
cd ./ta3ta2_integration
docker-compose pull
```

#### Run the Qntfy containers:

```bash
docker-compose up qntfy_ta2_worker
```

Wait ~5 seconds, then:

```bash
docker-compose up qntfy_ta2
```

### Run remaining containers:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/unchartedsoftware/distil
docker-compose pull
```

#### Comment out the pipeline-server entry in docker-compose.yml

```
# pipeline_server:
#   image:
#     docker.uncharted.software/distil-pipeline-server:latest
#   ports:
#     - "45042:45042"
#   environment:
#     - SOLUTION_SERVER_RESULT_DIR=$PWD/datasets
#     - SOLUTION_SEND_DELAY=2000
#     - SOLUTION_NUM_UPDATES=3
#   volumes:
#     - $PWD/datasets:$PWD/datasets
```

#### Uncomment the nk containers:

```
nk_classification_rest:
  image:
    primitives.azurecr.io/simon:1.0.0
  ports:
    - "5000:5000"
nk_ranking_rest:
  image:
    primitives.azurecr.io/http_features:0.4
  ports:
    - "5001:5000"
```

Run the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Build and run the server:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

## Vue + Vuex + Vue-Router Flow

We use [vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex), [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) and [vuex-router-sync](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex-router-sync) in the frontend app.

### Components / Views (vue)

The application is split into views, each comprised of one or more components.

### Routes (vue-router)

Everything is based off the route. The route contains **_entire_** reproducible state of the application. Therefore copy and pasting the current route into a new tab **_should_** result in the exact same view for a user.

The route is the ground truth and **_everything_** must be derivable from it. That is not to say that everything should go in the route. It should only contain the minimal information that is required to regenerate the state of the application. Any other data, typically pulled from the server via asynchronous requests, will be the result of actions dispatched to the store.

### Store (vuex + vuex-router-sync)

The store contains the route (via [vuex-router-sync](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex-router-sync)) and any auxiliary state that can be derived from the route.

### Application Architecture / Flow

Views are routed based off the URL, which is registered in `public/main.js`:

```javascript
const router = new VueRouter({
	routes: [
		{ path: '/route0', component: View0 },
		{ path: '/route1', component: View1 },
	]
});
```

Any change of state through user interaction is pushed to the router via the respective component:

```javaScript
methods: {
	clickOnButton() {
		this.$router.push({
			path: '/path',
			query: {
				someValue: this.computedValue,
			}
		});
	}
}
```

Components retrieve their values / data from the store via computed values:

```javascript
computed: {
	someRouteValue() {
		return this.$store.getters.getRouteValue();
	}
	someOtherData() {
		return this.$store.getters.otherData();
	}
}
```

Components watch the route for any change that may affect them. When a change occurs, and required action is then dispatched to the store. The store will update (via a commit), and a new value will be computed, thus updating the component.

```javaScript
watch: {
	someRouteValue() {
		this.$store.dispatch('someAction', this.someValue);
	}
}
```

Therefore the overall flow is:

- User interaction
- Component pushes to route
- Affected components dispatch actions from route watch
- Affected components computed new values from store changes
- View updates

NOTE: Any state that is shared between components should be managed by a higher level component rather than redundantly watching the route in multiple components. Ex. If components A and B both need state C which is dependent upon route query param D, a third component E should be created to watch the state and dispatch a single action upon change. Components A and B will then read from the store via computed values.

## Common Issues:

#### "dep: command not found":

- **Cause**: `$GOPATH/bin` has not been added to your `$PATH`.
- **Solution**: Add `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin` to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`.

#### "../repo/subpackage/file.go:10:2: cannot find package "github.com/company/package/subpackage" in any of":

- **Cause**: Dependencies are out of date or have not been installed
- **Solution**: Run `make install` to install latest dependencies.
